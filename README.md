## hey there ðŸª·
Love building things with **react** and **react native**. My current focus is working on making [Learn Anything](https://github.com/learn-anything) mobile & desktop adaptation.
The code is available in [open source](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything.xyz).
Also contribute to the development for digital marketplace on solana [Solbond](https://solbond.co) and [Kuskus](https://github.com/kuskusapp/kuskus), a food-sharing app.
Enjoy reflecting on my journey and capturing thoughts in [my diary](https://github.com/marshennikovaolga/dear-diary).
